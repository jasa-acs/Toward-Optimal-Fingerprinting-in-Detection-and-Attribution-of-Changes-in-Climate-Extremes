## Data

### Abstract

The provided data are the annual extreme temperatures: temperature of the warmest day of the year (TXx), the warmest night of the year (TNx), the coldest day of the year (TXn), and the coldest night of the year (TNn), in East Asia bounded by latitude 20N—50N and longitude 100E—145E. 

Both observed data and climate model simulation data are provided:
Observed temperature extremes of period 1951--2010 obtained from the HadEX2 dataset.
Climate model simulation data of period 1951—2010 obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model datasets.
Climate model simulation data of period 1861—2000 obtained from the Hadley Center Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3) dataset.



### Availability
